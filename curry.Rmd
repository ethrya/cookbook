### Notes
- Other (better?) recipes also use cardamon, cloves, star annise, fengreek leaves and cashews. It might be worth testing these.

This sauce is relatively chunky compared to restaurant butter chickens. To overcome this, I think the tomato can be added before the jackfruit and that sauce blended.
