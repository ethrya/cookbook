### Notes
I was concerned about not including butter or cheese. But this was actually fine and turneed out to be a bit lighter (better?) than other risottos I have made, but still rich enough.

## Falafel

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-orange.svg){fig-align="left"}](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing)

### Ingredients

#### Core Ingredients:
- **Chickpeas**: 2 cups, dried, soaked overnight
- **Brown Onion or Shallots**
- **Garlic**: 4–6 cloves
- **Fresh Parsley**: 1/2-1 cup
- **Fresh Cilantro**: 1 cup
- **Paprika**
- **Cumin**
- **Ground Coriander**
- **Salt**
- **Black Pepper**
- **Water**: As needed, a tablespoon at a time, to add moisture if the mixture feels too dry.

#### Optional Add-ins:
- **Mint**
- **Lemon Zest**
- **Chili**: 1/2 large red chillies
- **Fresh Ginger**: one small piece
- **Turmeric**
- **Sunflower Seeds**

---

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Mixture
1. **Soak the Chickpeas**  
   Place dried chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with plenty of water. Soak overnight (8–12 hours) until they are plump and softened. Drain and allow to dry.

2. **Blend the Ingredients**  
   In a food processor, combine the soaked chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and all spices. Pulse the mixture in short bursts until it has a coarse, grainy texture. It should hold together when pressed but not turn into a paste. Avoid over-blending.

3. **Adjust Consistency**  
   If the mixture feels too dry, add water one tablespoon at a time. If it’s too wet or loose, refrigerate to firm it up. Optionally, add a small amount of chickpea flour or breadcrumbs for extra binding.

4. **Chill the Mixture**  
   Transfer the falafel mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and make shaping easier.

#### Frying Instructions
5. **Prepare the Oil**  
   Heat vegetable, canola, or sunflower oil in a deep skillet or pot to 180–190°C. Use a thermometer for accuracy.

6. **Shape the Falafel**  
   Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the chilled mixture and shape it into balls or small patties. Work quickly to prevent the mixture from warming up.

7. **Test the Oil**  
   Drop a small piece of the falafel mixture into the oil. If it sizzles without burning, the oil is ready.

8. **Fry the Falafel**  
   Gently lower falafel balls or patties into the hot oil. Fry each side until golden brown and crispy.

9. **Drain the Falafel**  
   Remove the falafel from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
