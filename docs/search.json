The first pressure cook is optional, but is partly intended to break down the veges. It can be increased/decreased depending on hoe chopped the veges are (increase if they are less chopped).\nSpices should be used reasonably sparingly and are largely optional (pepper and praprica seem t obe good though). I’m still not sure which set of spices are optimal"

    "text": "Falafel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\nCore Ingredients:\n\nChickpeas: 2 cups, dried, soaked overnight\nBrown Onion or Shallots\nGarlic: 4–6 cloves\nFresh Parsley: 1/2-1 cup\nFresh Cilantro: 1 cup\nPaprika\nCumin\nGround Coriander\nSalt\nBlack Pepper\nWater: As needed, a tablespoon at a time, to add moisture if the mixture feels too dry.\n\n\n\nOptional Add-ins:\n\nMint\nLemon Zest\nChili: 1/2 large red chillies\nFresh Ginger: one small piece\nTurmeric\nSunflower Seeds\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nPreparing the Mixture\n\nSoak the Chickpeas\nPlace dried chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with plenty of water. Soak overnight (8–12 hours) until they are plump and softened. Drain and allow to dry.\nBlend the Ingredients\nIn a food processor, combine the soaked chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, and all spices. Pulse the mixture in short bursts until it has a coarse, grainy texture. It should hold together when pressed but not turn into a paste. Avoid over-blending.\nAdjust Consistency\nIf the mixture feels too dry, add water one tablespoon at a time. If it’s too wet or loose, refrigerate to firm it up. Optionally, add a small amount of chickpea flour or breadcrumbs for extra binding.\nChill the Mixture\nTransfer the falafel mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and make shaping easier.\n\n\n\n\nFrying Instructions\n\nPrepare the Oil\nHeat vegetable, canola, or sunflower oil in a deep skillet or pot to 180–190°C. Use a thermometer for accuracy.\nShape the Falafel\nScoop about 2 tablespoons of the chilled mixture and shape it into balls or small patties. Work quickly to prevent the mixture from warming up.\nTest the Oil\nDrop a small piece of the falafel mixture into the oil. If it sizzles without burning, the oil is ready.\nFry the Falafel\nGently lower falafel balls or patties into the hot oil. Fry each side until golden brown and crispy.\nDrain the Falafel\nRemove the falafel from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil."
